Welcome to my collection of notes, a blog perhaps. 

I am a front end - back end - middle end - developer by day, traveler by other days. 

You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/{{site.twitter_username}}) and [GitHub](http://github.com/{{site.github_username}}).

## Why blogging?

I am always writing, documentation is key to success in the software world. The multitude of wikis, papers, patents, and presentations I've authored yet kept within the closed confines of my proprietary companies should be set free. I'm not giving away anything proprietary, but want to share my notes and thoughts.

Hopefully this will allow me to better articulate my problems and solutions, while sharing and giving back.

There are many other benefits to blogging and sharing. Those are best articulated  in [@liquidise](https://github.com/liquidise) blog [Untold Benefits of a Software Blog](https://dev.to/liquidise/untold-benefits-of-a-software-blog)

## Under the hood
The blog currently is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and posts from WordPress have been migrated. The site is using a [beautiful theme designed by Heiswayi Nrird](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain) with minor custom modifications.
