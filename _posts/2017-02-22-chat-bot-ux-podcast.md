## Chat bots as UX

Recently I enjoyed a [@software_daily](https://twitter.com/software_daily) podcast episode titled [Robot Lawyer with Joshua Browder](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/12/02/robot-lawyer-with-joshua-browder). I do understand this was published a while back, I am perpetually behind with this podcast - a lot of excellent content coming out way faster than I can keep up with. 

I wanted to point out this specific episode not specifically for the parking ticket problems being solved, but how there was an emphasis on realizing that a really powerful UX tool existed. 

Using a chat bot for a user interface and user experience is a powerful interface for a wide variety of complex user input situations, particularly legal services.

I had a cursory following of the developments of chat bots though was looking for the right phrasing of what it solved. This episode gave that summary best, chat bots as a powerful tool in your UX toolset. 

I recommend giving the episode a listen.
