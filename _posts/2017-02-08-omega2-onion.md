## What is it?

A successful [KickStarter project ](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/onion/omega2-5-iot-computer-with-wi-fi-powered-by-linux)from 2016, delivering in early 2017

It works! The package I went with has the base Omega2, the [Power Dock](https://onion.io/store/power-dock/), and [Bluetooth LE Expansion](https://onion.io/store/bluetooth-expansion/)

Happy hacking everyone!
