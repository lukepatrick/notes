# Get Bluetooth Expansion Running on the Omega2



## Update

`$ opkg update`

## Install Bluetooth libs/utils

Find the packages

`$ opkg list | grep blue`

Install

`$ opkg install bluez-libs bluez-utils` 

## Remote Bluetooth Device Setup

Ensure your BLE USB device is connected properly

`$ hciconfig -a `

then turn on the USB device:

`$ hciconfig hci0 up`

`$ hciconfig hci0 sspmode enable`

`$ hciconfig hci0 piscan`

You should see blinking a blue light from the USB device.

## Bluetooth Control

To connect a device use **bluetoothctl**

Enter the command:

`$ bluetoothctl`

This is the **bluetoothctl** menu. Make the USB device discoverable/pairable and allow it to discover other devices.

Attempting to tab-autocomplete will give all the available commands. 

`$ show`

`$ agent on`

`$ discoverable on`

`$ pairable on`

`$ scan on`

Ensure you have another device to pair with and enabled, it will appear in the list after the scan. Copy the ID and use to pair.

`pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`

Prompt for a PIN, enter a value, e.g. `0000` and enter that on the remote device when prompted. Enable trust with the same device ID:

`trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`
